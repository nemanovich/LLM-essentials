Heart-shaped metacarpal/palmar (forelimb) or metatarsal/plantar (rear limb) pad\\n4. Usually four load-bearing digital pads, sometimes five or six toes\\n5. Carpal pad on forelimb for extra traction\\n6. Horn-like, beak-shaped claws on each digit\\n7. Generally hairless, but some animals have fur on paw soles (e.g., red panda)\\n\\nAnimals with Paws:\\n1. Felids (cats, tigers)\\n2. Canids (dogs, foxes)\\n3. Lagomorphs (rabbits)\\n4. Bears and raccoons\\n5. Mustelids (weasels)\\n6. Rodents\\n\\nThe article notes that paws act as cushions for load-bearing limbs and that some animals, like rabbits, have sharp nails but no pads underneath their paws.\", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=PromptCachingBetaUsage(cache_creation_input_tokens=1944, cache_read_input_tokens=0, input_tokens=4, output_tokens=286))"
